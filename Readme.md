This is a Running App I made in a Coding Jam over the Weekend.

Besides normal tracking of your run, you can set a so called ghost by selecting a run from your history.
The app will then tell you if the ghost finished half/complete distance while running.
This might help you to keep your pace or have some incentive to run faster.
